# Computer-Science-2

A collection of various projects I created in my Computer Science 2 class at Coppell High School using Java. Through the year, I have learned how to use Java Swing to 
create games and small applications with user input. Games like Pong and Snake required learning how to use paint() and a game loop for animating movement.
